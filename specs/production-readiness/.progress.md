# Progress

## Current

- **Phase**: implement
- **Task**: 1.1 Make `auth-service` JWT authorize `influencer-api`
- **Status**: not started

## Original goal

Make TWIST production-ready end-to-end

## Completed

- Drafted spec docs: `research.md`, `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`.

## Learnings

- Repo is already wired for edge deploy via Terraform and backend deploy via SSH to a VM, but backend “production readiness” is blocked by inconsistent/broken auth guards and mock chain settlement.

## Blockers

- Backend runtime target and secrets: `BACKEND_DEPLOY_HOST`, `BACKEND_DEPLOY_USER`, `BACKEND_DEPLOY_PATH` must point to an actual VM.
- Chain settlement scope decision: keep `packages/blockchain-sdk` as a stub for now (feature-gated) vs integrating real Solana programs before calling it “production”.

## Next steps

1. Implement task 1.1 (canonical JWT parsing + wallet->identity mapping).
2. Implement task 1.2 (remove Passport-only guards or wire a proper strategy).
