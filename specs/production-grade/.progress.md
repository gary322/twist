# Progress

## Current

- **Phase**: research → requirements/design/tasks (in progress)
- **Task**: 1.1 Materialize iCloud “dataless” files
- **Status**: in progress (repo currently contains many iCloud `compressed,dataless` files; Git operations can fail)

## Original goal

Make the TWIST monorepo production-grade end-to-end (buildable, testable, deployable to staging + production).

## Completed

- Spec scaffold created in `specs/production-grade/`
- Initial research writeup populated (repo components, constraints, risks)
- Requirements and design drafts populated (definition of “production-grade” for this repo)

## Learnings

- GitHub “deploy token” is not required for pushing from this machine if SSH auth is configured; prefer GitHub Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` + environment secrets for deployments.
- Biggest immediate blocker is iCloud “dataless” files causing partial reads and failed Git indexing.

## Updates (2026-02-06)

- Added iCloud preflight scripts + docs: `scripts/icloud/check.sh`, `scripts/icloud/materialize.sh`, `docs/dev/icloud.md`.
- Bootstrapped GitHub repo with an initial commit and pushed `main` to `git@github.com:gary322/twist.git`.

## Blockers

- iCloud hydration (owner: user/agent) (next action: run `scripts/icloud/materialize.sh` once created or “Download Now” in Finder)
- Runtime target ambiguity for backend services (owner: user) (next action: decide canonical backend + staging/prod runtime: k8s vs managed vs compose)

## Next steps

1. Create `scripts/icloud/check.sh` + `scripts/icloud/materialize.sh` and make Git/CI fail-fast if files are not materialized.
2. Create repo-root CI workflows and define the “v1 critical path” smoke suite.
